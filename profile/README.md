#### Tripela is a light, flexible automatic vehicle location (AVL) system.

It is designed to support the most common standards used in public transportation:

- GTFS,
- NeTEx,
- TransXChange,
- ITxPT.

The solution was designed to be suitable for Bus Open Data Service (BODS) compliance, as well.

### Who Is Tripela For?

Tripela offers several advantages to different stake holders in public transportation.

- **Public Transportation Authorities:**

  - PTAs can gain better understanding about the performance of transport services.
  - Information coming from an AVL, such as Tripela can be useful during the planning and policy making of public transportation.
  - AVL capabilities can become useful in case of emergencies when real-time information is critical.
  - Data coming from AVLs can be used to provide better communication with passengers.

- **Public Transportation Operators:**
  - PTOs can monitor their fleet in real time, allowing immediate adjustments to routes or schedules based on traffic conditions or vehicle issues.
  - Drivers can get real-time information about traffic conditions and alternate routes, helping them navigate more effectively.
  - Operators can inform passengers better about arrival times and digital displays.

### Features

Behind the benefits listed above there are multiple features that Tripela provides.

- **User and Vehicle Identity:** Tripela is ideal to use with smart phones of both the drivers and fixed devices on-board the vehicles.
- **Android and iOS Support**
- **Timetable Data:** Timetables can be viewed in timetable view, or the stops and the route are projected on the map.
- **Location Data:** Location data is at the core of Tripela. It's used to calculate expected arrival times.
- **Standardized Color Scheme:** Green indicates on-time arrivals, while early is shown as red, and late arrivals appear with a yellow tone.
